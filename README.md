## This is a Vue Chat App
### About :

- This is a realtime chat application, which is like a practice project of mine.
- This app has a login page, which requires your username. **It is recommended to not give any password as it is optional and no user authenctication is set-up in this project right now.** Once you login, you will be redirected to the chat view page where you can send your message as well as see what others have to say. Click logout button to exit the chat view page.
- I have used Vue3 (front-end framework) and Vue Cli for building this project.
- I have used Firebase for realtime db.
- I have deployed this project for hosting, on netlify app.
- I have future plans to work on this project and add more features along authentication.
